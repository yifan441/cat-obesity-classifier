Andy's super cool fat cat model

(surprised Pikachu face)

I collected 300 photos of skinny, normal, and obese cats (under datasets/[skinny/normal/obese], which you cannot see because I put the images in .gitignore).

This model aims to classify a user-given cat photo as either `skinny`, `normal`, or `obese`.

Generate the `annotations.csv` file by running `annotate_imgs.py`.

Check out how I am preprocessing the images by running `preprocessing.py`.

Model is coming soon...
